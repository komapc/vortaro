# French Pivot Integration - Vortaro Enhancement

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Enhancement:** Added French pivot translations and source attribution to vortaro dictionary

## Summary

The vortaro dictionary has been enhanced to use the **ONE BIG BIDIX** data source which includes French pivot translations, providing significantly more data than the previous version.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **More Data** 📈
- **Before:** 7,555 unique words (from simple merged dictionary)
- **After:** 9,601 unique words (from BIG BIDIX)
- **Increase:** +27% more coverage

### 2. **French Pivot Translations** 🇫🇷
- Added **1,010 translations** from French Wiktionary pivot
- Pivot translation uses French as an intermediate language to infer Ido↔Esperanto translations
- Example: If we know Ido→French and French→Esperanto, we can infer Ido→Esperanto

### 3. **Source Attribution** 🏷️
Every translation now shows its source with colored badges:
- 📕 **IO** - Ido Wiktionary (9,338 translations)
- 🇫🇷 **FR** - French Wiktionary pivot (1,010 translations)
- 📗 **EO** - Esperanto Wiktionary (189 translations)

### 4. **Enhanced About Modal** ℹ️
- Explains what pivot translation is
- Shows detailed source statistics
- Documents the extraction pipeline
- Lists all data sources with counts

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified
1. **app.js**
   - Changed data source from `dictionary.json` to `dictionary_big.json`
   - Added source tracking to each entry
   - Implemented `getBadgeClass()` and `getBadgeText()` functions
   - Enhanced About modal with pivot explanation and source stats

2. **style.css**
   - Added `.sources` and `.source-badge` styling
   - Created colored badge classes (`.badge-fr`, `.badge-io`, etc.)
   - Added `h4` styling for modal subheadings

3. **README.md**
   - Updated entry counts (7,555 → 9,600)
   - Added French pivot feature description
   - Explained pivot translation concept with example
   - Updated source statistics

4. **dictionary_big.json** (NEW)
   - Generated from `/home/mark/apertium-ido-epo/tools/extractor/ido-esperanto-extractor/dist/bidix_big.json`
   - Size: 1.5MB (vs 2.5MB for old dictionary)
   - Includes source provenance for each entry

## Data Sources

### Current Sources (from BIG BIDIX)
| Source | Translations | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Ido Wiktionary | 9,338 | Direct Ido→Esperanto translations |
| French Wiktionary | 1,010 | Pivot translations via French |
| Esperanto Wiktionary | 189 | Esperanto→Ido translations |
| **Total** | **~10,500+** | All translation pairs |

### Future Potential
The extractor pipeline also supports:
- English pivot translations (available but not yet integrated)
- Wikipedia language links (available)
- More Wiktionary language pairs

## User Experience

### Before
- Simple word list
- No indication of data source
- Limited coverage
- Only showed if word had translation

### After
- Source badges show data provenance
- French pivot expands coverage
- Clear explanation of how data was collected
- Users can trust translations more (see where they came from)

## Testing

The dictionary can be tested locally:
```bash
cd /home/mark/apertium-dev/vortaro
python3 -m http.server 8080
# Open http://localhost:8080
```

Try searching for words that have French pivot translations - they'll show a 🇫🇷 FR badge.

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

1. **Filter by Source**: Allow users to filter results by source (show only Wiktionary, only pivot, etc.)
2. **English Pivot**: Integrate English pivot data (726 entries available)
3. **Wikipedia Integration**: Add Wikipedia language links (thousands of entries available)
4. **Source Confidence**: Show confidence scores for pivot translations
5. **Multiple Paths**: Show when a translation comes from multiple sources

## Files Changed
- `app.js` - Data loading, source badges, About modal
- `style.css` - Badge styling
- `README.md` - Documentation updates
- `dictionary_big.json` - New data source (replaces `dictionary.json`)

## Impact

This enhancement makes vortaro a more comprehensive and transparent dictionary tool by:
1. ✅ Increasing word coverage by 27%
2. ✅ Adding French pivot translations  
3. ✅ Showing data provenance
4. ✅ Educating users about pivot translation
5. ✅ Maintaining fast load times (1.5MB vs 2.5MB)
